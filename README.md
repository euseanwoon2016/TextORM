# TextORM

Do you have a Java assignment where your lecturer prevents you from using a modern database to handle your data?

Are you FORCED to use crude .txt files as your data storage method?

TextORM is an Objectâ€“relational mapping framework that works with .txt files!

No longer would you have to wrestle with file opening and line splitting and re-writing whole files just to get your
data saved and read.

Querying data is as easy as

```java
Vaccine sinovac = TextORM.getOne(Vaccine.class, dataMap -> Objects.equals(dataMap.get("vaccineName"), "Sinovac"));
```

And saving data is as easy as

```java
new Vaccine("Sinovac", 21, 120.00, false).save();
```

All-in-one example

```java
Vaccine sinovac = new Vaccine("Sinovac", 21, 120.00, false);
sinovac.setdaysBetweenDoses(14);
sinovac.save();

List<Vaccine> finishedVaccines = TextORM.getAll(Vaccine.class, dataMap -> Boolean.parseBoolean(dataMap.get("isFinished")));
for(Vaccine vaccine : finishedVaccines) {
    vaccine.delete();
}
```

## Creating Models

Here is an example model

```java
@Repository
public class Vaccine extends Model {

    @Column
    private String vaccineName;

    @Column
    private int daysBetweenDoses;

    @Column
    private double cost;

    @Column
    private boolean isFinished = false;

    public Vaccine(String vaccineName, int daysBetweenDoses, double cost, boolean isFinished) {
        this.cost = cost;
        this.vaccineName = vaccineName;
        this.daysBetweenDoses = daysBetweenDoses;
        this.isFinished = isFinished;
    }

    public Vaccine() {
    }
    
    /* getters and setters... */
}
```

## Model Inheritance

Inheritance works as you'd expect. View example below.

in `Person.java`

```java

@Repository
public class Person extends Model {
    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private int age;

    @Column
    private double balance;

    @Column
    private LocalDate birthDate;

    public Person(String name, int age, double balance, LocalDate birthDate) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.balance = balance;
        this.birthDate = birthDate;
    }

    public Person() {
    }

    /* setters and getters... */
}
```

in `Account.java`

```java

@Repository
public class Account extends Person {
    @Column
    private String username;

    @Column
    private String password;

    public Account(String name, int age, double balance, LocalDate birthDate, String username, String password) {
        super(name, age, balance, birthDate);
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public Account() {
    }

    /* getters and setters... */
}
```

## Eager Loading for Related Models

TextORM also supports eager loading of related models. See below.

in `VaccineCenter.java`

```java

@Repository
public class VaccineCenter extends Model {
    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Double longitude;

    @Column
    private Double latitude;

    @Column
    private int vaccineId;

    @ForeignKey(foreignKey = "vaccineId")
    private Vaccine vaccine;

    public VaccineCenter(String name, Double longitude, Double latitude) {
        this.name = name;
        this.longitude = longitude;
        this.latitude = latitude;
    }

    public VaccineCenter() {
    }

    /* getters and setters... */
}
```

in `Main.java`
```java
VaccineCenter movenpick = TextORM.getOne(VaccineCenter.class, dataMap -> Objects.equals(dataMap.get("name"), "Movenpick"));
if (movenpick != null) {
    movenpick.include(Vaccine.class);
    System.out.printf("The vaccine at %s is %s and costs RM %,.2f. Is finished: %b", movenpick.getName(), movenpick.getVaccine().getVaccineName(), movenpick.getVaccine().getCost(), movenpick.getVaccine().isFinished());
    movenpick.getVaccine().setCost(Math.round(100.0 * (500.0 * Math.random())) / 100.0);
    
    // Saving the parent model also saves the included models.
    movenpick.save();
}
```

Still planning to add one-to-many relationships.
