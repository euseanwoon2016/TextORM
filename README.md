# TextORM
Do you have a Java assignment where your lecturer prevents you from using a modern database to handle your data?

Are you FORCED to use crude .txt files as your data storage method?

TextORM is an Objectâ€“relational mapping framework that works with .txt files!

No longer would you have to wrestle with file opening and line splitting and re-writing whole files just to get your data saved and read.

Querying data is as easy as

```java
Vaccine sinovac = TextORM.getOne(Vaccine.class, dataMap -> Objects.equals(dataMap.get("vaccineName"), "Sinovac"));
```

And saving data is as easy as

```java
new Vaccine("Sinovac", 21, false).save();
```

## Creating models

Here is an example model

```java
@Repository
public class Vaccine extends Model<Vaccine> {

    @Column
    public String vaccineName;

    @Column
    public int daysBetweenDoses;

    @Column
    public boolean isFinished = false;

    public Vaccine(String vaccineName, int daysBetweenDoses, boolean isFinished) {
        this.vaccineName = vaccineName;
        this.daysBetweenDoses = daysBetweenDoses;
        this.isFinished = isFinished;
    }

    // This is REQUIRED, it is used under the hood.
    // I am an incompetent programmer.
    public Vaccine() {
    }
}
```
